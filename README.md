and the name of the mountain is cheyenne (http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/Skynet) using which you can decrypt the key file then you get a text file, in which you see the pattern than all the number are less than or equal to 26(may be english characters), except 28 but for 28 hint is given and when you search that hint in google you get it is the underscore(image attached.) 
when you decode this message then you get password skynet_wants_to_destroy_humanity then you get calculas file there is some calculus equation when you solve them in order you get the flag....and the flag is iiita_aaprskyeydn42.
